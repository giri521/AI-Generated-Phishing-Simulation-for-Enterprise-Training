## Overview

AI-Generated Phishing Simulation for Enterprise Training is a web-based application that allows organizations to simulate phishing attacks using AI-generated templates. It helps train employees, raise awareness of phishing techniques, and improve overall cybersecurity posture.

## Features

* Generate realistic phishing email templates using AI.
* Simulate phishing campaigns and track user responses.
* Provide feedback and training for users who interact with simulated phishing.
* Web interface for administrators and users.
* Dashboard to monitor campaign results.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Flask
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Machine Learning / Natural Language Generation
* Pandas, NumPy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip
